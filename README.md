![AI Portfolio Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x300?text=AI+Portfolio+Hub)  <!-- Replace with actual banner if available -->

Welcome to my AI Portfolio Hub! I'm Michael Parkin, a front-end developer transitioning into an AI Engineer / AI-enhanced developer through a structured 26-week project-based learning roadmap. This repository serves as the central hub for my AI projects, showcasing my growing expertise in Python, data analysis, machine learning, and full-stack AI applications. Each project is a hands-on demonstration of real-world skills, built to solve practical problems and contribute to my professional portfolio.

Inspired by best practices for developer portfolios in 2025, this README highlights my journey, key projects, and technical growth. Feel free to explore the linked repos, star if you find them useful, or reach out for collaborations!

## 📝 About Me
- **Background**: Experienced front-end developer with a passion for augmenting my skills with AI. Currently following a project-based roadmap to master applied AI, from data science fundamentals to deploying intelligent systems.
- **Goals**: Secure a remote AI-enhanced developer role by building tangible, deployed projects that bridge front-end expertise with ML and LLMs.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, FastAPI, LangChain, Docker, AWS, React/Svelte.
- **Fun Fact**: I love turning messy real-world problems (like disorganized files or spending habits) into automated solutions! ⚙️

## 🛠️ Skills Acquired
Through this roadmap, I'm developing proficiency in:
- **Data Science Toolkit**: NumPy & Pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis 📊
- **ML Fundamentals**: Building intuitive visualizations of concepts like gradient descent 🤖
- **API & Full-Stack AI**: FastAPI for backends, LangChain for LLM apps
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization and AWS cloud hosting ☁️
- **Project-Based Learning**: From theory to shipped products, emphasizing pragmatic results

## 📂 Featured Projects
Here are the key projects from my 26-week AI transition roadmap. Each is self-contained, with code, documentation, and live demos where applicable. Click the links to explore!

### 1. Automated Directory Organizer 📁
- **Description**: A Python script that automatically sorts files in a directory by type (e.g., images to 'Images', documents to 'Documents'). Solves the common "messy downloads folder" problem with robust error handling and CLI support.
- **Tech**: Python, pathlib, argparse
- **Repo**: [Link to Repo](https://github.com/MichaelSParkin3/automated-directory-organizer)
- **Key Learning**: Intermediate Python, file I/O, data structures

### 2. Personal Finance Analyzer 💰
- **Description**: Analyzes bank transaction CSV to clean data, categorize spending (e.g., based on merchant names), and visualize patterns with charts. Reveals insights like monthly trends and category distributions.
- **Tech**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Repo**: [Link to Repo](https://github.com/MichaelSParkin3/personal-finance-analyzer)  <!-- Assume repo name; update if different -->
- **Key Learning**: Data wrangling, aggregation (groupby), vectorized ops

### 3. Interactive ML Concept Visualizer (In Progress) 🔍
- **Description**: Animated Jupyter Notebook visualizing gradient descent in linear regression—builds ML math intuition through code.
- **Tech**: NumPy, Matplotlib (animations)
- **Key Learning**: Linear algebra, calculus in code

More projects **coming soon,** including Predictor Model, Portfolio API, and a full-stack RAG system! 🚧
