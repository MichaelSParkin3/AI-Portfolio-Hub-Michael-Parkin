Welcome to my AI Portfolio Hub! I'm Michael Parkin, a front-end developer transitioning into an AI Engineer / AI-enhanced developer through a structured project-based learning roadmap. This repository serves as the central hub for my AI projects, showcasing my growing expertise in Python, data analysis, machine learning, and full-stack AI applications. Each project is a hands-on demonstration of real-world skills, built to solve practical problems and contribute to my professional portfolio.

## （づ￣3￣）づ╭❤️～ Personal Note

I really needed a roadmap to follow because the AI tech world is so infinitely changing and interesting. Every new tool or advancement sucks me in and I want to try out EVERYTHING. So starting this structured learning roadmap that makes sure to give me a foundational understanding is great. Without it I'd continue to jump around and tinker with every new thing every 24 hours lol. But yeah, LETS GOOOOO!

## 📝 About Me
- **Background**: Experienced front-end developer with a passion for augmenting my skills with AI. Currently following a project-based roadmap to master applied AI, from data science fundamentals to deploying intelligent systems.
- **Goals**: Secure a remote AI-enhanced developer role by building tangible, deployed projects that bridge front-end expertise with ML and LLMs.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, FastAPI, LangChain, Docker, AWS, React/Svelte.
- **Fun Fact**: I love turning messy real-world problems (like disorganized files or spending habits) into automated solutions! ⚙️

## 🛠️ Skills Acquired
Through this roadmap, I'm developing proficiency in:
- **Data Science Toolkit**: NumPy & Pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis 📊
- **ML Fundamentals**: Building intuitive visualizations of concepts like gradient descent 🤖
- **API & Full-Stack AI**: FastAPI for backends, LangChain for LLM apps
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization and AWS cloud hosting ☁️
- **Project-Based Learning**: From theory to shipped products, emphasizing pragmatic results

## 📂 Featured Projects
Here are the key projects from my AI transition roadmap. Each is self-contained, with code, documentation, and live demos where applicable. Click the links to explore!

### 1. Automated Directory Organizer 📁

- **Tech**: Python, pathlib, argparse
- **Repo**: [Link to Repo](https://github.com/MichaelSParkin3/automated-directory-organizer)
- **Key Learning**: Intermediate Python, file I/O, data structures

### 2. Personal Finance Analyzer 💰
- **Description**: Analyzes bank transaction CSV to clean data, categorize spending (e.g., based on merchant names), and visualize patterns with charts. Reveals insights like monthly trends and category distributions.
- **Tech**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Repo**: [Link to Repo](https://github.com/MichaelSParkin3/personal-finance-analyzer)  <!-- Assume repo name; update if different -->
- **Key Learning**: Data wrangling, aggregation (groupby), vectorized ops

### 3. Interactive ML Concept Visualizer (In Progress) 🔍
- **Description**: An interactive Jupyter Notebook that visualizes linear regression concepts using Python, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. Includes 2D animated plots and 3D regression planes to illustrate machine learning principles. 
- **Tech**: Scikit-Learn, Python, Numpy, Matplotlib
- **Repo**: [Link to Repo](https://github.com/MichaelSParkin3/interactive-ml-concept-visualizer)
- **Key Learning**: Linear regression concepts, Basic AI Training

More projects **coming soon,** including Predictor Model, Portfolio API, and a full-stack RAG system! 🚧
